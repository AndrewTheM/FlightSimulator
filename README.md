# FlightSimulator
One of my older projects that was my C# Exam.
Usage of WinForms was indeed not necessary but it seemed more suitable to me.
So this is the first WinForms experience I had, it is a bit raw in terms of clean code
however I consider the idea itself quite fascinating.

The app reminds of a flight simulator but it's more about training the pilots.
Using a simple model of a plane controlled by pretty much only the arrow keys,
it attempts to teach how to keep the situation in control.
Match your velocity and height to what the dispatchers recommend to successfully reach
all the goals from taking off to landing the plane.
